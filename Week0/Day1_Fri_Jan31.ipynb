    "## Physics 325\n",
    "### Spring 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "### The goals for today are to practice: \n",
    "  * using a Jupyter Notebook, \n",
    "  * sharing a document with GitHub Classroom\n",
    "  * our main source material today is Ch. 1 of Mark Newman's Computational Physics, and from it, I'd like us all to develop a sense of wonder about the possibilities of the cross-section of physics and numerical computing.\n",
    "  * we'll also have a preview of the following Ch. 2 concepts in coding fundamentals:\n",
    "      \n",
    "        * Variable defintions and types\n",
    "        * Input/Output (I/O) including print() \n",
    "        * Arithmetic and Order of operations\n",
    "        * print() our first Built-in Function\n",

    "#### Instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Today, I'll run a live demo using my Mac laptop.  We'll see how this goes... ;).  I'll set you free to play around a bit\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  You'll get this notebook via a Moodle link.  You'll download to your computer via. GitHub (but I've put this one on Moodle too just in case).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Complete the following exercises in-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Once I set you free, switch off between *driver* and *navigator* roles between each exercise.  Thus, if you are typing Python code on the computer for Exercise 1, your partner should be doing the typing on Exercise 2, and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. At the end of each exercise \n",
    "     * save your changes\n",
    "     * commit your changes (and make a note of what you changed in the \"commit\" boxes) \n",
    "     * push the changes to GitHub (where I can see/grade them).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You can and should use a whiteboard to enhance your thinking  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. __In the first few weeks, there may be A LOT of new concepts (and software) coming your way all at once.  PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED !!!!  The more questions you ask, the more I can tune the class to your level.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Don't be shy about copy/paste to recycle bits of code within the document.  Just make sure you understand what pieces you need and how to modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  At the end of the week, i.e. today, you'll submit the final copy of this notebook via GitHub to be graded."
